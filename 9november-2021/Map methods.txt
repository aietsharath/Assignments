Few Map methods
clear()	
This method is used to clear and remove all of the elements or mappings from a specified Map collection.

containsKey(Object)
This method is used to check whether a particular key is being mapped into the Map or not. 
It takes the key element as a parameter and returns True if that element is mapped in the map.

containsValue(Object)	
This method is used to check whether a particular value is being mapped by a single or more than one key in the Map. 
It takes the value as a parameter and returns True if that value is mapped by any of the key in the map.

entrySet()	
This method is used to create a set out of the same elements contained in the map. 
It basically returns a set view of the map or we can create a new set and store the map elements into them.

equals(Object)	
This method is used to check for equality between two maps. 
It verifies whether the elements of one map passed as a parameter is equal to the elements of this map or not.

get(Object)	
This method is used to retrieve or fetch the value mapped by a particular key mentioned in the parameter.
It returns NULL when the map contains no such mapping for the key.

hashCode()	
This method is used to generate a hashCode for the given map containing key and values.

isEmpty()	
This method is used to check if a map is having any entry for key and value pairs. 
If no mapping exists, then this returns true.

keySet()	
This method is used to return a Set view of the keys contained in this map. 
The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa.

put(Object, Object)	
This method is used to associate the specified value with the specified key in this map.

putAll(Map)	
This method is used to copy all of the mappings from the specified map to this map.

remove(Object)	
This method is used to remove the mapping for a key from this map if it is present in the map.

size()	
This method is used to return the number of key/value pairs available in the map.

values()	
This method is used to create a collection out of the values of the map. 
It basically returns a Collection view of the values in the HashMap.
