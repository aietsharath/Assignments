                                                            IdentityHashMap	                                                   WeakHashMap	                                                            EnumMap
References	                                IdentityHashMap stores strong key reference. 	                      WeakHashMap stores the weak key reference.	                  EnumMap stores the strong key reference.
Search and get the values	                It uses equality operator (==) to search and get the values.	      It uses equals() method for that purpose.	                          It also uses equals() method for that purpose.
Keys	It allows to store any type of keys.	It also allows to store any type of keys.	                      It allows to store only enum type keys.
Underlined data structure	                It uses the array as an underlined data structure. 	              It uses the HashTable as an underlined data structure.	          It uses the array as an underlined data structure.
Iterator	                                Iterator used in IdentityHashMap is Fail-fast.	                      Iterator used in WeakHashMap is Fail-fast.	                  Iterator used in EnumMap is weakly consistent.
Null Values	                                It allows to store null values.	                                      It allows to store null values.	                                  It doesnâ€™t allow to store null values
